- Put on gloves / lab gear (Usually gloves + coat + goggles)
- Gather materials
  - Beaker
  - Erlenmeyer flask w/ white chemical
  - Erlenmeyer flask w/ red chemical
- Bring to a table in the red zone
- !! You're getting a call! It might be urgent. Your phone is in the office, pick it up and press (B) to answer it.
- Phew, that was close. Now return to the experiment in the red zone.
- You need to set up a burette. Attach a funnel and a burette to the holder in the red zone.
- Next, fill the beaker with 5 drop from the Erlenmeyer flask with the white chemical. (Interrupted at picking up flask)
- !! It's time for a break. I think I saw some coffee in your office. Pick it up and press (B) to take a drink.
- Breaks over! Finish filling the beaker with 5 drop from the Erlenmeyer flask with the white chemical. 
- Now fill the burette with 10 drops from the Erlenmeyer flask with the red chemical.
- Titrate until you see a change of color in the beaker, or until you run out of red chemical. When you're done, bring the beaker into the yellow zone. (Interrupted as you begin to titrate!)
- !!Uh Oh! The printer is acting up again, and it's printing important data. Smack it once or twice with your hand to get it running right.
- Return to the red zone and titrate until you see a change of color in the beaker, or until you run out of red chemical. When you're done, bring the beaker into the yellow zone.
- Record your findings using the pencil and data sheet on the tables near the office. Touch the pencil to the paper to do so.
- The titration experiment is now complete. Please go to the trash to remove your gloves.
- This completes the glove hygiene module. We will now display all of the chemical spills created throughout the experience.
