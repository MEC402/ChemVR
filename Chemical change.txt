Chemical change
- put on gear message
- Bring the following materials to a table in the yellow section: 250mL Beaker, 100mL Graduated Cylinder, Glass Stir Rod, Stock Container of C6H12O6(Sugar).
- Locate these tools that you will use in the lab: DI water, Analytical Balance
- Fill the graduated cylinder with 50mL water.
- Turn on the analytical balance and allow it to stabilize. Make sure that it is configured to gram units.
- Place a weigh paper on the scale, and tare the balance to 0.000g.
- Weigh out 2g of sugar.
- Fold the paper, and pour the sugar into your empty beaker. Then pour in 50mL water into the beaker.
- Stir this solution with the glass rod.
- !! Is this a chemical change? Yes / No
-~~~~~~~~ Transition. Do they have to put things away?
- Bring the following materials to a table in the blue section: 250mL Beaker, Glass Stir Rod, Volumetric Pipette x2, Stock Containers of: CrCl3, NaOH, H2O2.
- Following the same instructions as before, weigh out 2g of CrCl3 on weigh paper, then add it into an empty beaker.
- (ELABORATE) Set up two volumetric pipettes with a bulb on top.
- Draw up 25mL of NaOH stock solution with a sterile pipette and transfer into the beaker, then stir this solution with a glass stir rod.
- Draw up 25mL of H2O2 stock solution with a sterile pipette and transfer into the beaker, then stir this solution with the glass stir rod.
- !! Is this a chemical change? Yes / No
- Place this beaker onto a hot plate, and turn the dial to ON, Level 3.
